1. Overview

A simple, browser-based endless runner in HTML5 + JavaScript (Canvas API).

Player controls a chosen ‚ÄúThing‚Äù character (Dave, Mel, Ash, or Charlie & Riley).

Player taps (or presses space/‚Üë) to jump over obstacles.

Game ends if the character collides with an obstacle.

Scoring is based on distance travelled + bonus points from collectibles.

Includes a leaderboard for tracking top scores.

2. Core Gameplay

Movement:
